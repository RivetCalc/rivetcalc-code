**RivetCalc** is a cross-platform, open source tool for writing 
engineering calculation documents.  It's implemented as a Python 
library that produces formatted calculation documents and reports 
in  UTF8, HTML and PDF file formats from plain text input.  The tool 
is designed  to improve editing, explicitness, clarity, reuse and review.
It eliminates the problem of unusable calculation inputs arising from 
incompatible binary files and programs. 

**RivetCalc** calculations are written in **rivet**, a light-weight, 
context and index based markup language. The language includes 
a dozen commands, tags, and a subset of reStructuredText that 
may be mixed arbitrarily with utf-8 text strings.

The **RivetCalc** API essentially consists of five string functions:

========== =======================================================
 API        Description
========== =======================================================
  R()       repository, report and calc summary information
  I()       insert descriptive text, tables, figures and equations
  V()       define and import values 
  E()       define and import equations and functions
  T()       define tables and plots 
========== =======================================================

A **RivetCalc** file is a Python file that typically imports 
*rivetcalc.rc_lib as rc* and calls the API functions as e.g. 
rc.R('''**rivet-string**'''), where **rivet-string** contains 
arbitrary text and **rivet** commands and tags.

Input file names (models) have the form *rddcc_calcname.py*. Corresponding 
output files (calcs) have the names *rddcc_calcname.txt*, 
*rddcc_calcname.html*, or *rddcc_calcname.pdf*; where dd (division) 
and cc (calculation) are two digit numbers used to organize PDF documents 
into collated reports. 

===================  =====================================================
File type             File description                                      
===================  =====================================================
design (.py)          text input, written in rivet                      
calc (.txt)           formatted UTF-8 output, written to screen (and file) 
doc (.pdf or .html)   formatted HTML or PDF output, written to file                  
report (.pdf)         organized and formatted PDF docs, written to file
===================  =====================================================       

Any file needed for a calcuation is stored in a project folder tree.  Calcs 
are written to the *calcs* folder in UTF-8 format.  Docs and reports are written 
to their respective folders in PDF and HTML formats when specified. Binary 
image files used in docs and reports are stored in the *html* folder. The user 
initially creates the complete folder tree either from scratch or starting with
an existing project or template::

  Project_Name (chosen by user)
      |- calcs
          |- sketches
          |- scripts
          |- tables
          |- text
          |- temp
      |- docs
          |- html
      |- reports
          |- attachments

Folders are restricted in the types of files they contain for the purposes of 
sharing templates and search. The *calcs* folder and sub-folders may contain only 
UTF-8 or ASCII files. Binary files, including image and PDF files, are stored in 
the *docs* and *reports* folders.

**RivetCalc** templates are full project trees with  UTF-8 *calcs* folders that
fully define a calc or set of calcs. The *docs* and *reports* folders are 
empty, except for a few default config files (needed to keep the folder 
structure intact on Github). Templates have the form::

  RivetCalcTemplate_nnn (nnn is a unique three digit number)
      |- calcs
          |- sketches
          |- scripts
          |- tables
          |- text
          |- temp
      |- docs
          |- html
      |- reports
          |- attachments

***RivetCalcTemplate_nnn*** is the literal Github repository 
name with a unique number.  The common name across all Github accounts
facilitates searches within calculations. Each account may contain many
templates (repositories). RivetCalc templates may be cloned, downloaded 
as a zip file, or run on Gitpod by the addition of a few setup files.

A minimum working version of **RivetCalc** includes a Python 
installation with a dozen Python science libraries 
(https://github.com/rivetcalcs/rivet-code/requirements.txt) 
and a text editor. In this case the input model is run from 
the command line as::

  python -m rivetcalc ddcc_calcname.py 

If a LaTeX distribution is installed, formatted PDF documents and 
reports can be generated. If an IDE or full-featured code editor 
is used the calculations can be executed interactively and in stages 
by tagging the API functions as cells. The program documentation, 
for example, focuses on the use case of **VSCode**, which 
dramatically increases calculation efficiency. Execution steps 
include::

**RivetCalc** may be installed by:

1. Locally Installing and configuring the individual open source components (a half dozen steps).
2. Locally downloading and unzipping a single no-install file for Windows (a couple of steps).
3. Remotely running a cloud service in a container (a dozen steps). 

A cloud installation (**RivetCloud.net**) is available with paid support. 
Refer to the **RivetCalc User Manual** for details.
